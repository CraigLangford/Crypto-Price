Looking around http://cryptocompare.com/api it seems we can convert any cryptoprice to any world currency. This can be achieved by making a request to https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym={from_symbol}&tsyms={to_symbol} and subbing in the 3 letter symbol of the cryptocurrency (BTC for Bitcoin) for the from_symbol and the 3 letter symbol of the world currency (USD for US dollars) to the to_symbol. [Here's the link](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=USD&tsyms=BTC) for USD to BTC as an example. The trick here, of course will be converting the users request to the correct three letter symbol.
